# Server-side JS

This is advanced. This folder contains code for setting up a basic web server to test our website against.

You must install node.js: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)

Then run `npm install` from the command line, inside the `server` directory (the current directory).

To start, run: `node server.js` from inside this directory. An alternate method, ONLY IF you have the Heroku Toolbelt installed, is to run `foreman start` from the parent directory.

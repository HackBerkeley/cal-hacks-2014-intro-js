# Cal Hacks JavaScript/jQuery workshop

In this workshop, I'll be giving you a brief overview of JavaScript, the programming language, and how you can use JavaScript (and tools like jQuery) to make web front-ends (websites) more interactive, and to get websites to communicate with servers.

I won't be teaching HTML/CSS.

## Prerequisites:

1. **You know how to code.** This workshop is not designed to teach you how to code. Ideally you already know a high-level language like Python or Ruby.
2. You can pick things up quickly. This will be relatively fast-paced.
3. Basic HTML/CSS knowledge. If you know more, even better - you'll be able to do more things with JavaScript.

# Hackers @ Berkeley & Cal Hacks 2014: Intro JavaScript and jQuery

In this workshop, I'll be giving you a rapid, fast-paced overview of JavaScript, the programming language, and how you can use JavaScript (and tools like jQuery) to make web front-ends (websites) more interactive, and to get websites to communicate with servers.

I won't be teaching HTML/CSS.

**This workshop will cover a lot more ground and will be faster paced than usual**

## Prerequisites:

1. **You know how to code.** This workshop is not designed to teach you how to code. Ideally you already know a high-level language like Python or Ruby.
2. You can pick things up quickly. This will be relatively fast-paced.
3. Basic HTML/CSS knowledge. If you know more, even better - you'll be able to do more things with JavaScript.
4. Please make sure you have `Google Chrome`. Optional: also install `Node.js` [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). (If you can't get node.js installed, don't worry).
